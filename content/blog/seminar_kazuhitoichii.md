#### Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is known as important greenhouse gases, and terrestrial
ecosystems play an important role as a CO2 sink. However, the magnitude of the CO2
budget of terrestrial ecosystem remains uncertain. Challenging toward accurate estimate
with smaller uncertainties are an essential research topic in earth system science,
including atmospheric science and ecosystem science. In particular, our science
community has entered &#39;data-rich&#39; era. More and more data, such as a network of site
observation data and various satellite-based observations, have become available for
atmospheric-land research. In this seminar, focusing on the study of material cycle in
the atmosphere-land, I will introduce recently available datasets (e.g., site observation,
remote sensing, and modeling) and how to apply it to carbon cycle research through
integration. I will also show some of the recent studies focusing on changes in terrestrial
CO2 budget in responding to climate variation and human effects across Asia.
