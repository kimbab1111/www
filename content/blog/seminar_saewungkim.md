#### Abstract

**Air Pollution – Observational Constraints in Relative Contributions from Transport in Relative Contributions from Transport vs Local Production and Their Scientific Limitations**

It is fair to say that most of the Korean citizens are eager to know exact contributions
from regional transport in their air pollution problems in one number. In the seminar, we will
discuss that it is an impossible to do. More importantly, a key uncertainty will be highlighted
surrounding constraining reactive gas precursors in the air producing aerosols and ozone
through photochemical processes. We will particularly discuss about observational constraints
quantified during the KORUS-AQ campaign in 2016. The particular uncertainties we have
identified are 1) substantial unknown reactive gases over the surface of the Seoul suburban
area and 2) rapid oxidation of the reactive gases over the surface. We will discuss their
implication towards assessing relative pollution contributions from local and transport. Finally,
the new airborne observation research initiative will be introduced to improve our
understanding in trace gas distributions that eventually empowering the modeling capacity and
the satellite data retrieval processes.
