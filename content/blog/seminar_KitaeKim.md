#### Abstract


Ice is ubiquitous in nature and provides a place for chemical reaction. According to Arrhenius’s equation, chemical processes take place slowly when temperature decreases. However, several chemical transformation are accelerated by freezing. Takenaka et. al. reported that the NO2- oxidation to NO3- in the presence of O2 which is very slow reaction in aqueous solution was significantly accelerated (appx. 105 times) by freezing. Freeze Concentration Effect (when solution is solidified the existed organic/inorganic compounds are separated from ice crystals and highly concentrated in unfrozen part or ice grain boundaries in ice) is regarded as main driving force for the accelerated processes in ice. In this talk, we want to introduce enhanced chemical reaction with laboratory experimental results such as 1) accelerated dissolution of metal oxides in ice, 2) quick removal of toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants by freezing, and 3) activation of iodine compounds in ice. The detailed experimental conditions and mechanism will be discussed in the presentation.
