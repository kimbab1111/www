#### Abstract

**Parameterizations of Subgrid Orographic Drag and Non-Orographic Gravity Wave Drag for Korean Integrated Model (KIM) System**

Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems (KIAPS) has developed a new global
forecast system, the Korean Integrated Model (KIM) system, since 2011 to replace the current
operational model at Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which has been adopted
from the United Kingdom’s Met Office Unified Model. In this talk, the parameterization
schemes of subgrid orographic drag and non-orographic gravity wave drag (GWD) for the KIM
system are introduced. The mesoscale (the scale range 4 km to the model resolution) orographic
drag scheme parameterizes the drag due to gravity wave breaking, low-level wave breaking,
and flow blocking. The inclusion of flow-blocking drag increases the orographic drag in the
lower troposphere noticeably. The enhanced drag directly weakens the excessive wind speed
in the low troposphere and indirectly improves the temperature and mass fields over East Asia
during the winter season. In addition, the snowfall overestimation over Korea is improved by
the reduced heat fluxes from the surface. Both the low-level wave breaking and flow-blocking
drag improve the intensity of a summertime continental high over the northern part of the
Korean Peninsula, which is exaggerated with GWD only. This is because the enhanced lower
tropospheric drag due to the effects of low-level wave breaking and flow blocking slows down
the wind flowing out of the high-pressure system in the lower troposphere. It is found that the
decreased lower-level divergence induces a compensating weakening of middle- to upper-level
convergence aloft. The effect of drag due to subgrid orography with turbulent scales (the scale
range smaller than 4 km), the so-called turbulent orographic form drag, is introduced by
revising the surface exchange coefficient for momentum. The inclusion of turbulent orographic

form drag reduces positive wind bias in the near-surface and low atmosphere. The non-
orographic GWD scheme parameterizes the effects of convective and frontal gravity waves

with wide phase speed spectra. The convective GWD scheme replaces the existing one that
considers only a stationary convective GW, and the frontal GWD scheme is newly introduced.
The source-based non-orographic GWD scheme improves the seasonal representation of
stratospheric wind, through changes in both the GWD and the resolved wave forcing, which is
modulated by the changed large-scale wind due to the GWD. The downward influence, in
response to the changed GWD, is also positive in the tropospheric fields, such as subtropical
jet and planetary-scale disturbances.
