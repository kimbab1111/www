#### Abstract

**Unidata Science Gateway: A Cloud-based Platform for Enabling Open and Reproducible Science**

Cloud computing represents a fundamental change in the way IT services are developed, deployed, operated, and paid for, placing science communities in the middle of a major paradigm shift. There is also broad consensus that as data volumes grow rapidly, it is important to reduce data movement and bring processing and computations to the data. We need to give scientists an ecosystem that includes data, tools, models, and modern workflows, all residing in a cloud-like environment. Instead of moving data to users, data providers need to facilitate bringing analysis, visualization and other applications and tools to data – so called data proximate workflow capabilities.
Unidata, a cyberinfrastructure facility, has been developing big-data infrastructure and data- driven scientific workflows using cloud computing technologies for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing geoscience data. Unidata has implemented the aforementioned services on the Unidata Science Gateway, hosted on the Jetstream cloud, a cloud facility funded by the U. S. National Science Foundation. Through the Unidata Science Gateway, researchers can gain access to an array of well-integrated resources.
In this talk, we will present our work to date in developing the Unidata Science Gateway and the hosted services therein, as well as our future directions to benefit the atmospheric sciences community.
