#### Abstract
In this seminar, we introduce three current research projects related to carbon cycle and
contemporary climate change. Firstly, we are evaluating urban enhancement of atmospheric
CO2 over the Seoul through analyzing mobile, tower-based, and satellite measurements (1.
Seoul carbon cycle). Secondly, we are investigating the role of terrestrial ecosystem in
atmospheric CO2 variations of Korea by analyzing atmospheric CO2 measurements from
Anmyeondo, satellite, and models (2. Korea carbon cycle). Finally, we try to understand the
impact of human activity on global-scale long-term variations in atmospheric CO2 by
analyzing carbon inventory-based emission data, satellite, and models (3. Global Carbon
Cycle). Three research projects will help us to understand the carbon cycle and then reduce
the uncertainties in future climate change projections.
