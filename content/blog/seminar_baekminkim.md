#### Abstract
We provide series of evidences that Atlantic windstorms of extreme
category in northern winter tend to follow a well-defined route toward
the Atlantic sector of Arctic, and that heat and moisture transported
by these extreme storms significantly warm the Arctic. A positive
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) condition and the associated
intensified upper-level Atlantic jet provide favorable conditions for
those extreme storm developments through enhanced vertical wind
shear. These extreme windstorms lead to two discernible impacts on
the Arctic: 1) enhanced poleward energy transport by moisture
intrusion to the Arctic, which accompanies increased longwave
downward radiation and 2) the occurrence of Euro-Atlantic blocking
after the storm break-up. During these periods, significant Arctic
warming was observed of a 10-fold increase versus normal and weak
storms. The poleward deflections of extreme storms, and the Arctic
warming driven by such storms, are well simulated in numerical
experiments with coupled models.
