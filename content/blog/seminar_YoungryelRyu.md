#### Abstract

Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SiF) has been increasing used to monitor canopy photosynthesis over the global land. The photons that are intercepted by chlorophyll have three pathways: photochemistry, fluorescence and non-photochemical quenching. Among three pathways, fluorescence is the only one that can be detected by optical remote sensing. However, fluorescence is a tiny signal that is only a few percent of absorbed photons by vegetation. To detect such tiny signal, atmospheric scientists applied sophisticated methods to extract SiF from Fraunhofer lines or O2A bands. In the presentation, I show opportunities and challenges in quantifying canopy photosynthesis via the narrow atmospheric bands.
