**Potential impacts of regional and large-scale climate variability on Asian aerosols activity: an observational investigation using ground and satellite measurements**

Anthropogenic and natural aerosols emitted from the East Asia have received a great attention partly due to
their potential impacts on environment and climate over the past decades. In today’s talk, I will introduce potential
impacts of regional and large-scale climate variability on Asian aerosols activity (i.e., emissions and transports)
based on an observational investigation using ground and satellite measurements.
First topic: Potential impacts of northeastern Eurasian snow cover on generation of dust storms in
northwestern China during spring.
The effects of the northeastern Eurasian snow cover on the frequency of spring dust storms in north- western
China have been examined for the period 1979–2007. Averaged over all 43 stations in northwestern China, a
statistically significant relationship has been found between dust-storm frequency (DSF) and Eurasian snow water
equivalent (SWE) during spring: mean DSF of 7.4 and 3.3 days for years of high and low SWE, respectively.
Further analyses reveal that positive SWE anomalies enhance the meridional gradients of the lower tropospheric
temperatures and geopotential heights, thereby strengthening westerly jets and zonal wind shear over northwestern
China and western Inner Mongolia of China, the regions of major dust sources. The anomalous atmospheric
circulation corresponding to the Eurasian SWE anomalies either reinforces or weakens atmospheric baroclinicity
and cyclogenesis, according to the sign of the anomaly, to affect the spring DSF.
Second topic: Springtime trans-Pacific transport of Asian pollutants characterized by the Western Pacific (WP)
pattern.
Springtime trans-Pacific transport of Asian air pollutants has been investigated in many ways to figure out its
mechanism. Based on the Western Pacific (WP) pattern, one of climate variabilities in the Northern Hemisphere
known to be associated with the pattern of atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific Ocean, in this study, we
characterize the pattern of springtime trans-Pacific transport using long-term satellite measurements and
reanalysis datasets. A positive WP pattern is characterized by intensification of the dipole structure between the
northern Aleutian Low and the southern Pacific High over the North Pacific. To evaluate the influence of the WP
pattern, we examine several cases of trans-Pacific transport reported in previous research. Interestingly, most
trans-Pacific transport cases are associated with the positive WP pattern. This study reveals that the WP pattern
can be utilized to diagnose the strength of air pollutant transport from East Asia to North America.
