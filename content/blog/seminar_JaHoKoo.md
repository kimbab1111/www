**Atmospheric chemistry in East Asia and the Arctic: Questions for individual issues and their connection**

This talk represents questions significantly considered about the atmospheric chemistry/environment issues in East Asia and the Arctic, and also discusses the level of current findings for these issues. In East Asia, the most serious problem now is the high amount of tropospheric ozone and aerosols, and their increasing trend. For the reduction of ozone and aerosols, chemical processes of precursors such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) should be clarified. Their properties have been examined using intensive/continuous observations and model experiments, consequently we now better figure out the temporal variation and spatial distribution of precursors related to the pattern of ozone and aerosol formations. Nevertheless, more efforts look necessary to guarantee the consistent result between observations and model outputs. In the Arctic, halogen chemistry in the heterogeneous phase (gas and particle) is mainly investigated associated with the tropospheric
ozone and mercury deposition, which can damage the polar air quality and eco-system. The most difficult problem here is to find the proper condition inducing the efficient halogen exchange between the gas and particle phase. Based on many researches so far, first-year sea ice and blowing snow are assumed as preferred particle phases, but the effective meteorological condition (e.g., temperature and wind speed) for the halogen chemistry is still debatable. Based on these findings, chemical/environmental feedback can be considered between East Asia and the Arctic. In addition to the inspection of intrinsic chemical properties, synthesis approaches based on various fields of atmospheric sciences will enable us to better understand the large- scale connection of regional environmental issues.
