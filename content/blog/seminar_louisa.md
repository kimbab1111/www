#### Abstract

**Impact of anthropogenic and natural emissions on air quality in Korea: CAM-chem model analyses of KORUS-AQ observations**

Measurements over Korea during May-June 2016 as part of the KORUS-AQ (Korea-U.S. Air
Quality) campaign showed an increase in ozone mixing ratios from May into June, coincident
with increasing biogenic emissions of isoprene and other compounds as temperatures
increased. Korea is heavily forested outside the Seoul megacity, resulting in a unique
atmospheric environment with very high anthropogenic emissions next to seasonally high
biogenic emissions. To accurately simulate air quality here, models must include appropriate
oxidation schemes for high amounts of NOx, anthropogenic VOCs and biogenic VOCs. A global
chemistry model CAM-chem (CESM2) has been run for the KORUS-AQ campaign period. The
simulations are evaluated with the full suite of observed ozone precursors, including NOx,
organic nitrates, hydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs).
Evaluations of the online biogenic emissions model MEGAN in CAM-chem are made through
comparisons with observations of isoprene and terpenes, as well as OVOCs, such as methanol
and acetone.
