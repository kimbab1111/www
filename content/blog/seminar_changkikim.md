#### Abstract
In December, 2017, the Korean Government announced the “Renewable Energy 3020
Plan” that renewable energy will be responsible for 20 % of generation in electricity by 2030.
To accomplish this goal, 30.8 GW of solar power plants will be installed with 16.5 GW of
wind power plants. There is still question if it is feasible or not. Korea Institute of Energy
Research attempted to answer the question through renewable energy resource assessment.
First step is to derive the theoretical renewable energy potentials which are consistent to the
energy intensity or amounts from the earth itself. For example, annual solar insolation for
target region is usually called theoretical renewable energy potential. However, there are
technical limitations in installation of renewable energy systems as well as regulation due to
environmental destruction. Consequently theoretical renewable energy potentials will be
reduced by taking into account the technical limitations. This is definition of technical
renewable energy potentials. Then, costs for generation the electricity by the renewable
energy might be compared with those by traditional energy such as nuclear power or
charcoal. Most of countries supports the subsidy or tax credits to business sector for the
renewable energy system. Economic (Market) renewable energy potentials is available
renewable energy power that can be produced at low cost with government policy, comparing
to traditional power plants. In this presentation, current status of renewable energy potentials
in Korea will be presented to answer the feasibility of “Renewable Energy 3020 Plan”.
With great increase of solar power generation in the electricity grid system, electricity
balance between load and supply has been suffering from the variability in renewable energy.
From the feasibility study, it is projected for solar energy to produce the electricity enough to
compensate for the energy load during daytime. After sunset, however, electricity load will be
relatively raised within a couple of hours. To avoid black out crisis, back-up system should be
required. In addition, fast moving clouds usually reduce the solar power generation within a
couple of minutes, which leads to the large ramp rate. Large fluctuation of electricity affects
the frequency of AC power system. Therefore, renewable energy power forecasts are
essential to solve the problems in relevant with ramp rates. This presentation will introduce
the forecasting methods in terms of forecast horizon in Arizona and California; satellite
derived solar irradiance for short-term forecast and numerical weather prediction for daily
ahead forecast.
