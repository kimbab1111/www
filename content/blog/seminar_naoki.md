**Coastal Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment with Small-Scale Fisheries**

Coastal fishing economy has been shrinking in the last few decades in Japan (and
probably similar in Korea). To save the small-scale fisheries, a new research project "Smart
coastal fisheries with information and communication technology" has been funded by Japan
Fisheries Agency since 2017. The virtue of small fisheries is the small influence to the
environment. Our accurate ocean prediction can help their effective operations to catch the
bare minimum of fishes at minimum cost. The coastal ocean prediction in the
Tsushima/Korea Strait has been quickly recognized by the local fishermen. They are
frequently visiting our web site (http://dreams-d.riam.kyushu-u.ac.jp/) and discussing the best
fishing ground/time before the departure. Minimization of fuel and labor should be
contributing to their income and working environment already. The accuracy of ocean
prediction can be improved by number of data. The smart fisheries project is also inventing a
new CTD instrument dedicated to the fishermen. This simple, small, and affordable CTD is
now at evaluation phase and will be on domestic sale in 2019. The important parameters of
the TKS model have been already calibrated by using recycling Green's functions with the
constraint of institutional CTD data. For instance, the bulk transfer coefficients of sensible
and latent heat fluxes were modified to the opposite directions, respectively. The calibration
of open boundary conditions is decreasing the cost function even more effectively. The
optimization of such parameters has been already applied to the operational run. In the
following years, dozens of CTD castings are expected from the fishing activities to increase
the accuracy of the coastal ocean model through the approximate Kalman filtering.
