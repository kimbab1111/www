#### Abstract

**Beyond the shallow water equation: Convective parameterization … and beyond.**

Earth's atmosphere is nothing but fluid and the Navier-Stokes equations
simplified for a shallow water system is good enough to understand the large scale
features of it. However, to represent and simulate the behavior of the small scale
disturbances of the atmosphere hiding behind the approximations while deriving the
shallow water equations, we need convective parameterization. The fact that the biases
due to inappropriate representation of the small scale disturbances can grow and
eventually contaminate the large scale atmospheric circulations makes the issue of
convective parameterization even more crucial. Convective parameterization has been a
long standing issue in simulating the global climate. Traditionally based on the quasi
equilibrium assumption, it has evolved beyond the traditional approach in recent times.
Two such approaches are super-parameterization (SP) and stochastic multi-cloud model
(SMCM) approach.
In this seminar, I shall talk on why we need convective parameterization, problems of
traditional convective parameterization approaches and the need for approaches like SP
and SMCM and see some of the results from climate simulations made using SP and
SMCM.
