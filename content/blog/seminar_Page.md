#### Abstract

**COMET's Support of University Teaching in Geosciences**

The COMET Program has been providing educational resources to the geoscience community for over 28 years. A key strength of the program is the work of COMET instructional designers to craft training that meets the needs of the operational community to improve job performance. An additional application of these efforts is using the conceptual model animations and explanations in the classroom. The operational focus of COMET materials provides effective real-world examples that apply the scientific information being presented in universities. More recently, the program has expanded delivery of training to include educational videos through the COMET YouTube channel. New efforts to support the university community include the development of a lab packages for courses in synoptic meteorology and instrumentation.
In the past two years, COMET has participated in international workshops to discuss how academic institutions can support national meteorological services by infusing operational applications of meteorology to better prepare graduates of their programs to work as weather forecasters. COMET’s training supports the forecasting competencies that have been developed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
COMET is part of the UCAR Community Programs (UCP), and this presentation is part of a UCP effort to connect with the universities to better understand how we can support their education and research efforts.
