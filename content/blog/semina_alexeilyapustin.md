#### Abstract
The Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) is a standard
MODIS algorithm that uses time series analysis for advanced cloud/snow detection and
characterization of surface bidirectional reflectance. Due to its high accuracy and unique 1km
resolution, MAIAC aerosol product is widely used in the air quality research and applications
globally. Recently, we adapted MAIAC to process geostationary AHI-8 HIMAWARI and
ABI GOES-16 measurements. In this talk, I will describe MAIAC basics with analysis of
validation and broad range of air quality applications.
