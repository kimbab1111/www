#### Abstract
During the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) experiment the National Science
Foundation/National Center for Atmospheric Research Gulfstream-V (G-V) aircraft sampled the upper
anvils of two storms that developed in eastern Colorado on 6 June 2012. A cloud particle imager (CPI)
mounted on the G-V aircraft recorded images of ice crystals at altitudes of 12.0 – 12.4 km and T= –61 –
–55 °C. A total of 22,393 CPI crystal images were analyzed, all with maximum dimension D max &lt; 433 m
with an average D max of 80.7±45.4 m. The occurrence of well-defined pristine crystals (e.g., columns and
plates) was less than 0.04% by number. Single frozen droplets and frozen droplet aggregates (FDAs) were
the dominant habits with fractions of 73.0% (by number) and 46.3% (by projected area), respectively. The
relative frequency of occurrence of single frozen droplets and FDAs depended on temperature and
position within the anvil cloud.
A new algorithm that uses the circle Hough transform technique was developed to automatically identify
the number, size, and relative position of element frozen droplets within FDAs. Of the FDAs, 42.0% had
two element frozen droplets with an average of 4.7±5.0 element frozen droplets. The occurrence
frequency gradually decreased with the number of element frozen droplets. Based on the number, size,
and relative position of the element frozen droplets within the FDAs, possible three-dimensional (3-D)
realizations of FDAs were generated and characterized by two different shape parameters, the aggregation
index (AI) and the fractal dimension (D f ), that describe 3-D shapes and link to scattering properties with
an assumption of spherical shape of element frozen droplets. The AI of FDAs decreased with an increase
in the number of element frozen droplets, with larger FDAs with more element frozen droplets having
more compact shapes. The D f of FDAs was about 1.20–1.43 smaller than that of black carbon (BC)
aggregates (1.53–1.85) determined in previous studies. Such smaller D f of FDAs indicates that FDAs
have more linear chain-like branched shapes than the compact shapes of BC aggregates. Determined
morphological characteristics of FDAs along with the proposed reconstructed 3-D representations of
FDAs in this study have important implication to improve the calculations of the microphysical and
radiative properties of ice crystals in upper anvil clouds.
