#### Abstract
Ocean boundary current systems are characterized by the energetic surface velocity and vigorous
coastal upwelling with a rich filamentary eddy structure. The associated large anomalies and
gradients of surface current and SST modify the surface stress, triggering so-called mesoscale
air-sea interactions. This presentation will discuss results from high-resolution regional coupled
model simulations with a scale-separation of the air-sea coupling, showing that mesoscale air-sea
interactions through SST and surface current exert dynamically distinct influences on the
energetics of these boundary current systems. Effect of SST-wind coupling is manifested most
strongly in the Ekman pumping velocity, which primarily affects the position of the eddy fields
but not their amplitude. In contrast, the current-wind coupling substantially reduces the total
wind work, thus the mean and eddy kinetic energy. The vorticity-induced Ekman pumping
through the current-wind coupling further attenuates the eddy amplitude. Significant time-mean
responses in SST and evaporation are found due to the current-wind coupling in the Arabian Sea,
suggesting its potential importance to downstream atmospheric monsoon circulation.
