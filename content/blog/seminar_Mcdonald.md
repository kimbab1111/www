**Chemical Product Emissions Emerging as Important Urban Source of Volatile Organic Compounds**


Over multiple decades volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the transportation sector have decreased by over an order of magnitude. As transportation emissions decline, other sources of urban VOCs are growing in relative importance. This talk focuses on emissions from the everyday use of volatile chemical products (VCPs), including personal care products, cleaning agents, inks, coatings, adhesives, and pesticides. In the Los Angeles basin, VCPs now account for around half of the petrochemical VOCs emitted. This potentially has important air quality implications for secondary species formed in the atmosphere, including ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Since many chemical products are used in residential and commercial buildings, emissions also affect indoor air quality. In this seminar, I will discuss approaches to estimate VOC emissions from VCPs, and their potential impacts on urban air quality. Second, I will discuss chemical tracers that can be used to detect the presence of VCPs in the ambient atmosphere, including the utility of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5-siloxane). D5- siloxane is a common ingredient in North American personal care products. Lastly, I will discuss terpene compounds emitted from VCPs. Terpenes are common fragrances, and also found in cleaning agents and other consumer products. To assess anthropogenic terpenes, I will show results from recent NOAA field measurements of VOCs in New York City during the New York Investigation of Consumer Emissions (NY-ICE) Study in 2018. Measurement of VOCs were made by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) and whole air canister samples analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). An anthropogenic signal of terpenes was detected in New York City, and distinguishable from biogenic sources.
